Daemonsets:
A DaemonSet in Kubernetes is a type of controller that ensures a copy of a specific pod is running on all or selected nodes 
in a cluster. DaemonSets are typically used for deploying system-level components that need to run on every node, such as:

Logging and Monitoring Agents: Tools like Fluentd, Prometheus Node Exporter, or Datadog agents, which collect logs or metrics 
from each node.
Networking and Security Components: Network plugins like Calico or Cilium, or security tools like Falco, that need to run on 
every node for consistent functionality.
When a new node is added to the cluster, the DaemonSet controller automatically schedules the required pods on the new node. 
If a node is removed, the pods managed by the DaemonSet on that node are also removed. This helps ensure that the desired state
of the system components is maintained across the entire cluster.
