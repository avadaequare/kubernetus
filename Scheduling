Manual scheduling
if you want to manually scedule a pod in a paerticular node you can do it by specifying nodeName: node (nodename) in pod .yaml file
example:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  nodeName: node01
  containers:
  -  image: nginx
     name: nginx
	 
make sure u delete pod if there is any existing pod before running it again after node name is added.
