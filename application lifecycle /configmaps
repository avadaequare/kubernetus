configmaps
A ConfigMap in Kubernetes is an API object used to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs. 
It allows you to separate configuration details from the application code, making it easier to manage and update configurations
without needing to rebuild or restart your application.

Here are some key points about ConfigMaps:

Decoupling Configuration from Code: By using ConfigMaps, you can decouple configuration details from the container image, enabling more flexibility in configuration management.

Key-Value Pairs: ConfigMaps can store data in key-value pairs, where both keys and values are strings. This data can be used by your applications as environment variables, command-line arguments, or configuration files.

Data Storage: ConfigMaps can store simple values (like strings) or complex configurations (like JSON, YAML, or other formats).

Mounting ConfigMaps: You can mount ConfigMaps as volumes in your pods or use them as environment variables. This makes it easy to inject configuration data into your containers at runtime.

Updating ConfigMaps: ConfigMaps can be updated independently of the application using them. This is useful for making configuration changes without redeploying the entire application.

Integration with Secrets: While ConfigMaps are suitable for non-sensitive data, Kubernetes Secrets are used for storing sensitive information like passwords, tokens, or keys.

Example of a ConfigMap
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a ConfigMap YAML file:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example-config
data:
  config-key: config-value
  another-key: another-value
You can then reference this ConfigMap in your Kubernetes deployment or pod specification to provide the necessary configuration data to your application.

Overall, ConfigMaps are a powerful tool in Kubernetes for managing application configuration and promoting a more dynamic and flexible deployment process.
